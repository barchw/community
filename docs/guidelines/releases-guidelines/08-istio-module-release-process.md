This document describes how to create a release of Istio module.

## Release content

An Istio module release consists of:

* A GitHub release with automated changelog generation and embedded release notes from `docs/release-notes` directory, corresponding to the release tag
* Image for Istio operator
* Artifacts including sample Istio CR `default-cr.yaml` and Istio module installation manifest `istio-manager.yaml` 
* A release tag and branch holding the code

## Steps

1. Create a release branch in the `istio` repository. The name of this branch must follow the `release-x.y` pattern, such as `release-1.2`.

   >**NOTE:** This step applies only to new major and minor versions.

2. After creating the branch run GitHub action `Create release` on the branch to start the release pipeline. Provide the release tag as parameter to starting the workflow and optionally select from when should the changelog be generated.

3. After the release pipeline finish, there should be a new release available

4. Create a PR with the ModuleTemplate artifact generated by the `rel-istio-module-build` Prow job to `kyma/kyma-modules`
   >**NOTE:** This step might change or be unnecessary in the future

5. [Configure Dependabot](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml) to watch the release branch if a new one was created.
